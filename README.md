This program will generate a pie chart that contains expenses for the last month.
The categories will be: rent, gas, food, clothing, car payment, and misc.
The program will accept values for these from input, and place them into a text file.
The program will then take the values, either read from the file, or from input and display them
in a pie chart, also will track: total spent.

In the future, I would like to add the ability to read data from a file and pull up a pie chart for the data in the file so that monthly expenses can be compared more easily.

This app uses datetime, numpy, and matplotlib.
